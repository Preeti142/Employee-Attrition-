# Employee-Attrition
It helped us to predict the consequences of the employees who left their job. Analysis done using Python.

Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of 
employees over time. In general, relatively high attrition is 
problematic for companies. HR professionals often assume a 
leadership role in designing company compensation programs, 
work culture and motivation system that help the organization 
retain top employees. 
 
 The dataset includes features like Age, Employee Role, 
Daily Rate, Job Satisfaction, Years At Company, Years in Current 
Role, etc. For this exercise, we will try to study the factors that 
lead to employee attrition. 

A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an 
organization. Job postings, hiring processes, paperwork and 
new hire training are some of the common expenses of losing 
employees and replacing them. This is especially concerning if 
your business is customer facing, as customers often prefer to 
interact with familiar people. Errors and issues are more likely if 
you constantly have new workers.
